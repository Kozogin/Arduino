SMS Double relay

Status: not used, unfinished.

The purpose of the device is to turn on the active load (up to 3 kW) with weekly programming.
Settings are sent via SMS. Namely the setting number, switch-on time, switch-off time. 6 parameters are distributed so 3 weekdays, 2 Saturday, 1 Sunday.
Separately for each relay.
Setting the system clock, turning on the evening presence mode (with pseudo RND on), and in the same way.
RND mode is alternative.
If at the end of the message there is a word back, the sender is returned an SMS where the type of mode and its parameters are specified. This applies to the time setting
On the Arduino uno (8 bit 2kbt RAM), of which 256 b was taken to the UART buffer, there was not enough memory to handle String. 
So I rewrote the methods written in Visual Studio, where everything worked
the SMS is written to the EEPROM and then processed.
