wi-fi termostat

Status: is used, updated;
Designed for paired control of gas and wood boilers

Control is carried out by means of 6 temperature sensors which are located on 1 bus
The device contains a real-time module for the operation of the weekly programmer of the gas boiler
Control of a wood boiler consists in management of 2 pumps of contours
You can configure the weekly programmer and change the settings using the 5 touch buttons on the device
Namely technical adjustment of thermal parameters, choice of wi-fi network, password, purpose of temperature sensors and correction of their data
As well as setting the time, token to access the blynk service for remote management
All parameters can be written to flash memory.

I want to note this nuance
Automation is located near the airfield, and sensors are mounted on long wires.
The sensors were unstable and even failed. Surprisingly, the principle of dynamic zeroing of the sensor bus solved this problem.
